**Intelligent Agents for Debugging and Optimising Distributed Data and AI Platforms**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa03284c-a071-400c-ba30-e89c0595e1ef)

We're building the next generation of AI-powered debugging and optimisation tools for distributed data processing frameworks. Our agentic AI systems understand the deep execution semantics of complex distributed workloads and provide expert-level insights through natural language interfaces.

## 🎯 Mission

Transform distributed system debugging from manual detective work into an intelligent conversation. Our agents don't just monitor - they understand, reason, and provide actionable solutions for complex distributed computing challenges.

## 🛠️ Available Tools

### **Spark History Server MCP** 🔥 *[Available Now](https://github.com/DeepDiagnostix-AI/spark-history-server-mcp)*
Connect AI agents to your Apache Spark infrastructure for intelligent job analysis and
performance monitoring.

**Key Features:**
- **🤖 AI-Native Interface**: Query Spark data through natural language via Model Context Protocol
- **📊 Performance Analysis**: Compare jobs, identify bottlenecks, and get optimization recommendations
- **🔍 Historical Insights**: Deep dive into completed jobs with comprehensive metrics analysis
- **⚡ Production Ready**: Kubernetes deployment with Helm charts, security best practices
- **🔗 Framework Agnostic**: Works with LangChain, LlamaIndex, Claude Desktop, and custom AI agents

**Perfect for:** Data engineers wanting to add Spark monitoring capabilities to their AI
agents and workflows.

## 🚀 Current Development

### **SparkSense-AI** 🔥 *(Coming Soon)*
We're currently finalising our flagship project - an intelligent debugging and optimisation agent for Apache Spark on Kubernetes.

**What makes it special:**
- **Multi-agent architecture**: Specialised agents for debugging, optimisation, and autonomous monitoring
- **Domain expertise**: Fine-tuned LLMs trained on Spark source code and documentation  
- **Natural language interface**: Ask "Why did my job fail?" and get expert-level answers
- **Enterprise ready**: Production-grade architecture with modern protocol integration

**Status**: Final testing and documentation in progress. **Follow this organisation** to be notified when we release the open source repository.

## 🔮 Future Vision

**Planned Agent Family:**
- **FlinkSense-AI** - Stream processing diagnostics and optimization
- **RaySense-AI** - Distributed ML workload analysis and tuning  

*Each agent will share the same intelligent architecture but specialize in framework-specific expertise.*

## 🏗️ What We're Building

### **Agentic Intelligence**
- **Specialized Agents**: Domain-expert agents trained on actual source code
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Agents work together for complex cross-system issues
- **Autonomous Operations**: 24/7 monitoring with proactive failure prediction

### **Beyond Traditional RAG**
- **Structured Data Reasoning**: Precise query generation instead of similarity search
- **Multi-step Investigation**: Intelligent escalation across data sources
- **Evidence-based Analysis**: Grounded in actual logs and metrics, no hallucinations

### **Production Ready**
- **Unified Data Architecture**: ClickHouse-powered analytics foundation
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multi-tenant, cloud-native architecture
- **Cost Optimized**: Smart query strategies and optional embedding usage
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Flexible deployment across different environments

## 📈 Why This Matters

**Current Reality:**
- Data engineers spend 40-60% of their time on reactive troubleshooting
- Manual correlation across fragmented observability tools
- Dependency on platform experts for complex failure analysis
- Days to resolve issues that should take minutes

**Our Solution:**
- **Natural language debugging**: "Why did spark-123456 fail?" → Instant expert analysis
- **Proactive optimization**: Catch issues before they impact production  
- **Self-service expertise**: Junior engineers get senior-level insights
- **Framework intelligence**: Deep understanding of execution semantics, not just generic monitoring
